Caveats:
- Scraping DTEK Regions outage website is tricky, as it uses an anti-bot system.
  I can only able to bypass the anti-bot system by using third-party scraping services.
  Such services cost ~2.5 EUR per 1000 requests.
  If the page on my hosted cache-server is updated every 30 minutes, the maximum price for this is 2.5 EUR for 20 days.
  One obtained cookie might be used more than once, so the real price can be lower than that (or much lower).
  If someone is interested in this, I could implement all this on my own, I just need an API key of said service.
